# Bike rental data management
This repository contains all the files created during Codecademy's bike rental data
management project.

## Project Overview
The popularity of bike and e-bike rental schemes has increased rapidly throughout
major cities around the world. This project creates a relational database to store
bike rental data from Citi Bike and weather data from NOAA and analytics-ready views 
to probe the data:
The project was achieved via:
* inspecting and cleaning the datasets from Citi Bike and NOAA using Python
* designing a relational database structure 
* creating a PostgreSQL database and importing the data from the Jupyter notebook
* using SQL to develop analytics-ready database views 

## Folder Structure
* bike_rentals.ipynb: data inspection, cleaning and preparation for database
* tables.sql: SQL queries to create the database tables
* views.sql: SQL queries to create the database views
* database_schema.pdf: schema used to create the database

## Data
* JC-2016xx-citibike-tripdata: monthly Citi Bike data from Jersey City throughout
